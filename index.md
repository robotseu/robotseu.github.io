## Research
+ Robot Grasp and Manipulation Skill Learning 
  
  We combine deep reinforcement learning methods and GANs for learning sim2real transferable skills for robot manipulations. In particular, we enable generalizable 6DoFs robot grasping with CNN based grasp pose detection methods.   

 
+ Learning-by-demonstration
  
  We exploit symbolic learning of manipulation tasks from human demonstration as well as task-parameterized trajectory learning with DMPs, IPs and other motion primitive models. Learning contact force related skills is also considered for transfering human manipulation skills to robots.
 

+ SLAM and applications
  
  We aim the provide visual/lidar SLAM methods for mobile robots, UAVs and other 3D reconstruction applications.
